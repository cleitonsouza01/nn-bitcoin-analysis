# Bitcoin Data Analysys with Neural Network
Coded by Cleiton Souza (cleitonsouza01@gmail.com)

## Purpose
 The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to demonstrate the use of Python to analyze financial data, in this case, bitcoin, using power of neural network to do predictions.

 In this code I am using bitcoin as an example, but the code can be easily changed to other types of assets like stocks, forex or options.
